# A Note on Erdős Problem #856

This repository contains a short mathematical note motivated by a discussion 
on Erdős Problem #856 on the Erdős Problems website:

> https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/856

In the comment section, Bloom suggested that my long proofs were difficult to 
read when split across several nested replies, and encouraged me to write 
them up as a short PDF that could be linked from the discussion.
