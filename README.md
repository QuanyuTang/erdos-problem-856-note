# A Note on Erdős Problem #856 (superseded by a full paper)

This repository contains an early short mathematical note motivated by a discussion on
Erdős Problem #856 on the Erdős Problems website:

> https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/856

In the comment section, Thomas Bloom suggested that long proofs are difficult to read when split
across many nested replies, and encouraged me to write them up as a short PDF that could be linked
from the discussion.

**Update (Dec 2025).** We have written a complete research paper
developing the full theory for general $k$, including upper/lower bounds for $f_k(N)$ and a
precise connection to the Erdős–Szemerédi sunflower conjecture (Problem #857):

- Quanyu Tang and Shengtong Zhang, *Harmonic LCM patterns and sunflower-free capacity*,
  **arXiv:2512.20055**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20055

The PDF/TeX note in this repository should be viewed as a **preliminary write-up** (mainly for the
\(k=3\) case) and is **superseded** by the arXiv paper above.
